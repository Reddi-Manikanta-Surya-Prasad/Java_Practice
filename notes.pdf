# variables -> Variable is the basic unit of storage in a java program.
# Declaring & Initializing a variable 
#     --> Example --> int a = 10;
#     here int is the type tof variable we want and 
#     --> Declaration: int a
#     --> Initializing: int a = 10; 

# Primitive Data types: 

# Integers: 
# byte  --> -128 to 127(1byte), 
# short --> -32,768 to 32,767(2 bytes), 
# int   --> -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647(4 bytes), 
# long  --> -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807(8 bytes), 

# Decimals data types:
# float  --> -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647(4 bytes),
# double --> -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807(8 bytes)

# character data type:
# char --> 0 to 127

# boolean data types:
# boolean --> true/false

# Type Casting: Converting one data type to another data type.

# --> Implicit Type casting
# --> Converting a lower data type to a higher data type is called Widening data type or Implicit data type.
       * Both data types must be compitable with each other.
       * The target type must be larger than the source type.
       BYTE --> SHORT --> CHAR --> INT --> LONG --> FLOAT --> DOUBLE
       

# --> Explicit Type casting
# --> Converting higher data type into a lower data type is called Narrowing type casting or Explicit type casting.
#       DOUBLE -->FLOAT --> LONG --> INT --> CHAR --> SHORT --> BYTE

# Conditions --> if, if-else, Nested-If
# LCM & HCF and Ratio and Proportion
